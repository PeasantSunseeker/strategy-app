For version control, our team is using git, with a central repository located on Bitbucket.
This was done due to familiarity with Bitbucket, the convenient features it has,
	as well as the added security of having a backup of our repository on a remote host.
Two of the members of our team had previously used Bitbucket. We could both attest to its
	shallow learning curve for the sake of the third member, and it allowed for a
	quicker start up for our project.
Bitbucket also has nice features. It keeps a visualization of the branches that have been
	checked out. It also keeps a record of who committed what, when they committed it, what
	branch it was committed to, and the source. It has some copy-pasteable git commands for
	common functions.
Having a remote repo hosted by a large company also adds security. There’s a much higher chance
	of a student’s cheap laptop dying then there is of a crash at Bitbucket resulting in loss
	of our data. Also, even though we’re not really concerned about someone hacking our repo
	and gaining the secrets of efficient solar car usage, the prestige of Bitbucket’s creators,
	Atlassian, leads to the feeling that it’s unlikely anyone besides us can see our repo.
