Many of these standards are described here:
	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf
With modifications for our own purposes.

Java source files have the following ordering:
	-Beginning comments (see “Beginning Comments” below)
	-Package and Import statements; for example:

		//package statement goes before import statements
		package edu.wmich.whatever
		import java.applet.Applet;
		import java.awt.*;
		import java.net.*;

	-Class and interface declarations 

1. Beginning Comments

	Change intellij ActionScript file header to this:


		/**
		 * PROJECT: ${PROJECT_NAME}
		 * AUTHOR: ${USER}
		 * DATE: ${DATE}
		 *
		 * DESCRIPTION:
		 *
		 *
		 * 
		 *
		 * 
		 * 
		 *
		 */

	Which will create this block comment above all new Java classes created.

2. Class or Interface statement

	public class MyClass {
		//write code here
	}

3. Class Variables

	Declare static variables before instance variables. 
	Declare in the order public, protected, private.

	Example:

		public static int num1;
		protected static int num2;
		private static int num3;

		public int num4;
		protected int num5;
		private int num6;

4. Constructors 

	Declared after Class Variables.

5. Methods

	From Oracle's "Java Code Conventions":

		These methods should be grouped by functionality
		rather than by scope or accessibility. For
		example, a private class method can be in
		between two public instance methods. The goal is
		to make reading and understanding the code easier.

Line Length

	//the line below is 79 characters including the beginning tab
	Avoid lines longer than 80 characters, since they’re not handled well by many 
	terminals and tools

Code Formatting

	Press Ctrl + Alt + l in Intellij to use auto formatting. It should suffice in
	most situations.

	JFreeChart uses some constructors with many parameters, for clarity you can 
	put each constructor parameter on its own line, preferably with comments.

	Example:

	        JFreeChart chart = ChartFactory.createXYLineChart(
                title, //chart title
                "Time of Day", //y-axis label
                "Power", //x-axis label
                data,
                PlotOrientation.VERTICAL,
                true, //include legend?
                true, //include tooltips?
                false); //include URLs?
            //end constructor call

Comments:

	From Oracle's "Java Code Conventions":

		Comments should be used to give overviews of code and provide additional information that is not readily available in the code itself. Comments should contain only information that is relevant to reading and understanding the program. For example, information about how the corresponding package is built or in what directory it resides should not be included as a comment.

	There are three styles of comment:

		//this is a comment
		
		/* this is also a comment */

		/*
		 * This is a block comment
		 */

Declarations:

	It is preferred that there is only one declaration per line. That is,

		int level; // indentation level
		int size; // size of table
		Object currentEntry; // currently selected table entry

	Is preferable to

		int level, size;

	Put delcarations only at the beginning of blocks. 

		void myFunc() {
			int num1;	//beginning of method block
			if(condition) {
				int num2;	//beginning of "if" block
				...
			} //end if
		} //end myFunc

	Declarations of for loop iterators can be declared in the for statement.

		for(int i = 0; i < numLoops, i++) {

		}
