-Ownership will be transferred to sunseeker team at completion.

-This will allow for control of the code to be retained by the team. 

-This will allow for changes to be made over the course of the sunseeker lifetime by the team and possibly other senior design projects.

-We have not chosen open-source as this tool will give a competitive edge to the WMU team.

-We do not believe an NDA is necessary as there is no market for the sale of this source-code. However, this needs to be discussed with the client.
