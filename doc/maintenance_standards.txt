	For maintenance purposes we are going to keep a config file containing info that might change, such as battery capacity, car weight, rolling resistance. This will allow non-programmers to account for changes to the car, without having to dive into code.
	For developers intent on tweaking and improving our programming in the future, we will strictly follow the coding standard and document our code well.
	We will avoid hardcoding the route in so that if the route changes, the team won't be stuck without this program.
